          <p>Making a really good quesadilla is a life skill that everyone should have. This recipe is simple—seasoned ground beef + melty Monterey jack + avocado—and almost every element can be substituted or skipped. (While it doesn't matter what kind of cheese you use, cheese is essential.) Unlike our chicken quesadillas, which calls for loading half a tortilla with filling then folding the other half of tortilla on top, this recipe calls for the plate flip method. Which, by the way, is way easier than it seems! The benefit to such a dramatic technique: You cook bigger quesadillas more quickly. </p>
